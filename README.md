MIPS
====

A very simple MIPS core.

- 28 integer instructions in the MIPS-I instruction set are implemented.
- Modified Harvard architecture.
- No pipelining. All instructions are single-cycle.

This core was designed in only one week. It was for the course project of VLSI designing, and will be fabricated with 180nm technology.
